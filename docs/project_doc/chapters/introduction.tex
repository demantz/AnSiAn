\ac{AnSiAn} is an Android application by the Secure Mobile Network Lab (SEEMOO) at 
Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. It features a graphical signal analyzer that can be used with common \acp{SDR} like the
HackRF and the RTL-SDR. The project is based on RF~Analyzer, an application by
Dennis Mantz. \ac{AnSiAn} currently extends RF~Analyzer by the following features: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Time Domain Signal Graph (Waveform)
	\item Morse Decoder
	\item Scanner
	\item Codebase structured according to the \ac{MVC} pattern
\end{itemize}

This lab aims to further extend the feature set of \ac{AnSiAn} while also
making the app more stable and refining existing features. The description of
the project goals are listed in \autoref{ch:project_definition}.
